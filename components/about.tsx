            My master's journey not only solidified my belief in technology's potential but also deepened my resolve to {" "}<span className="italic">make a meaningful impact</span>. Now, armed with a wealth of experience and a profound appreciation for the possibilities of technology, I am  {" "} <span className="underline italic font-medium">seeking a full-time role</span> as a software developer.
